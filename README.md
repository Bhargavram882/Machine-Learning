K-Nearest Neighbour Classification
Consider the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification. Implement K-nearest
neighbour classifier and estimate the optimal value of K (from K=1, 3, 5, ..., 21) using r-fold cross vali-
dation (for r=5). Submit the classification result (create a confusion matrix) along with training error and
testing error for the optimal K. Plot the precision-recall (PR) curve for optimal K value across all the classes.
